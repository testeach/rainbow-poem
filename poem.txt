**the rainbow and the unicorn from the Wild Wild West**
I'm the Poney here
- and it's so sunny with a dog in --


this is a written poem
which in Dutch rhymes with bloom
and in French with je t'aime
and I also have an oral poem
which in Dutch rhymes with nothing
while in French it's still a poème

the aimd for the MASTER (of no ponies)
and now this is the forked version in the recycled branch
